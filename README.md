# Demo Animated UI Compnents

It is a part of a Animated UI Kit Project. Animated UI Kit is a modern, high-performance animated component library built with Radix UI, managed through a pnpm monorepo structure with Turborepo for optimal development experience.

Here, I am building and testing the components for customization and for adding/applying defferent type on aniamtions on it.

The main purpose of building this is to demo and check the feasibility of components that developers will be using the main in project. If it looks good and can be customised then we will add it in [Animated UI Kit](https://github.com/lakinmindfire/animate-ui/tree/dev)
